# Facial Recognition and Profiling using Face++

#### You need to ensure that the Free API Key from Face++ is working.

#### A detailed documentation of all Face++ Queries can be found [here](https://console.faceplusplus.com/documents/5679127).

### 1. Comparison: Face++ FREE vs PAID versions

According to Face++ website:

|                Free API                               |        Pay-per-use API               |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Maximum 1 query per second                            | Maximum 10 queries per second        |
| Detect only 5 largest faces in a photo                | Detect all faces in a photo          |
| Can use ALL Face++ APIs for free, expect SDK Auth API | Pay extra for SDK license activation |
| Create up to 1000 FaceSet                             | Unlimited number of Faceset          |
| Limited and not guaranteed QPS capacity => it is likely that API usage will be returned with "CONCURRENCY_LIMIT_EXCEEDED" error message             |               (to be tested)         |

Using Pay-per-use API, the user is (1) charged daily based number of face_token and time period stored, (2) charged in near real-time per API usage (e.g each face detected).

We conduct a small test to compare the efficiencies of two API:
* **Data**: 30 images from Botanic Gardens - **`images_info.csv`** ([here](data/images_info.csv))


* **Free API**:
    * Only 16/28 images were successfully uploaded into Face++ for detection.
    * Detected 44 faces out of 16 images.
    * Only 23/44 faces were successfully added to Face++ Faceset.
    * Out of 23 facial images, 22 unique faces were identified.
    * The resultant dataset of these 23 faces can be found [here](data/combined_facial_info.csv)
    
    
* **Paid API**: 
    * All 28 images were successfully uploaded into Face++ for detection.
    * Detected 47 faces out of 28 images.
    * All 47 faces were successfully added to Face++ Faceset.
    * Out of 47 facial images, 44 unique faces were identified.
    * The resultant dataset of these 23 faces can be found [here](data/others/combined_facial_info_paid.csv)

### 2. Facial Profiling using Face++

For this demo, we will use the photos downloaded from Botanic Gardens (their details are [here](data/images_info.csv)). Please check out the documentation on [POIS Generation & Data Collection](POIS_generation_&_Data_collection.md) for the detailed instruction on retrieving these photos.

Note that the `api_key` and `api_secret` in the codes below are for **FREE API**. A different set of api_key and api_secret need to be substituted to use PAID API.

#### The Python script can be found [here](scripts/Facial_Recognition+Profiling_Face++.py).

#### 2.1 Detect faces from images:

Upload images to Face++ for facial detection

```sosense
curl -X POST "https://api-us.faceplusplus.com/facepp/v3/detect" -F "api_key=WcfwQJC2Uz5usfGJKpdb_uKkWkhvV893" -F "api_secret=xkVAIQuL5xgI-pG1dAIxb--d1umTIg9j" -F "image_file=[image_path]" -F "return_landmark=2‚Äù -F "return_attributes=gender,age,ethnicity"  
```

* Retrieve **Gender, Age, Ethnicity, Bounding Box, Face_token** for each facial image into a dataframe - **Face++_detection.csv** ([here](data/Face++_detection.csv)). 

<br>
   
### 2.2. Add facial images to Faceset 

We want to create a database of faces of individuals present in Singapore. The same individuals can appear in multiple photos taken at different locations (though the face angles and expressions can be different). Therefore, we must find a way to label each set of facial images belonging to the same person by a unique user_id.

We can do this by:

* For each new facial image, check whether it is already added in the Faceset.
```sosense
curl -X POST "https://api-us.faceplusplus.com/facepp/v3/search" -F "api_key=WcfwQJC2Uz5usfGJKpdb_uKkWkhvV893" -F "api_secret=xkVAIQuL5xgI-pG1dAIxb--d1umTIg9j" -F "face_token=[face_token]" -F "outer_id=18"   
```
* If it is not added yet, add the image to the Faceset. 
```sosense
curl -X POST "https://api-us.faceplusplus.com/facepp/v3/faceset/addface" -F "api_key=WcfwQJC2Uz5usfGJKpdb_uKkWkhvV893" -F "api_secret=xkVAIQuL5xgI-pG1dAIxb--d1umTIg9j" -F "outer_id=18" -F "face_tokens=[face_token]"
```
* While adding the face, Face++ will find its closest facial match among the faces already existing in the Faceset. Retrieve **the closest facial match, user_id & Confidence level (%)**
```sosense
lst.append([i,msg['results'][0]['user_id'],msg['results'][0]['confidence'],msg['results'][0]['face_token']])
```

<br>

### 3. Generate unique user_id for faces

* If the closest facial match has Confidence < 80, we reject this match:
    * This means that the new facial image belongs to a face not yet to exist in the Faceset.
    * Proceed to assign a unique user_id to this new face:
    ```sosense
    curl -X POST "https://api-us.faceplusplus.com/facepp/v3/face/setuserid" -F "api_key=WcfwQJC2Uz5usfGJKpdb_uKkWkhvV893" -F "api_secret=xkVAIQuL5xgI-pG1dAIxb--d1umTIg9j" -F "face_token=[face_token]" -F "user_id=[desired_id]"
    ```

* If Confidence > 80, we accept this match:
    * This means that the new facial image belongs to a face already existing in the Faceset - the same face of its closest facial match.
    * Proceed to assign the new facial image with the user_id of its closest match.
    ```sosense
    curl -X POST "https://api-us.faceplusplus.com/facepp/v3/face/getdetail" -F "api_key=WcfwQJC2Uz5usfGJKpdb_uKkWkhvV893" -F "api_secret=xkVAIQuL5xgI-pG1dAIxb--d1umTIg9j" -F "face_token=[closest_match_face_token]"
    ```
    * If its closest match also does not have a user_id yet, set a unique user_id for both images. 

<br> 

#### 4. Merge Face++ Profiling and Instagram photo data 

The resulting dataframe, **`combined_facial_info.csv`** will contain the following features:

* **Face_token**: The face token assigned to the facial image by Face++ during detection.
* **Image_name**: The name of the image downloaded from Instagram
* **Timestamp**: The time at which the image was posted on Instagram
* **Insta_user_id**: The unique User Id of the Instagram account that posted the image
* **Fpp_user_id**: Unique IDs for an individual in the Faceset in Face++
* **Gender**: Gender of the face as detected by Face++	
* **Age**: Age of the face as detected by Face++
* **Ethnicity**: Ethnicity of the face as detected by Face++
* **Bounding Box**: Frame of the face as detected by Face++ (saved for later verification if required)

Append this dataframe to an existing master file in the local directory, which should contain **details of all facial images ever downloaded from Instagram and detected by Face++**. An example of the resulting dataframe can be found [here](data/combined_facial_info.csv)
